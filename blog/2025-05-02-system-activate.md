I'm really excited to share that I will be playing at
[System Activate](https://systemactivate.com), a new rite of the Motherbeat, in
Central Vermont this summer.

Close friends will know that my
[first (known) experience with the Motherbeat](https://www.instagram.com/p/BYTTvR9hC1g/)
was at Eris Drew's set at
[TUF til Dawn in 2017](https://www.tuf-seattle.com/tuffest-2017). It is what
motivated me to start DJing again. I am so thankful for the journey it set me
out on.

Naturally, when I received the invitation to play, my first reaction was to
start bawling.

I'm already so anxious to share music with friends new and old at this
experimental, intentional rave. Be sure to check out the site and read more
about the idea.
